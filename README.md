# Movie App
This is my personal experimentation Android app, I use movie-app to mess around with and test different libraries and technologies I am interested in. This project also serves as a guide for articles I write on the Medium blogs.

Check out this article on Medium on Dagger2:
[Finally! A simpler approach to Dagger2](https://medium.com/@ivann.r/ivann-ruiz-simplest-approach-to-dagger2-mvp-kotlin-android-592047e1a74b)

## Android Tech List
Here is the list of Android tech I want to experiment with and incorporate into this app

- [x] Use MVVM and ViewModel
- [x] ViewModelFactory with multibinding
- [x] Use Anko layout library instead of XML
- [x] LiveData
- [x] Use Moshi instead of Gson
- [x] Data Binding
- [ ] Modularize the app
- [ ] Replace RxJava Observable streams with LiveData
- [ ] Migrate away from Groovy to Kotlin DSL as build script
- [ ] Using RecyclerView to display movies on the UI
- [ ] Add Dependencies.gradle [Kotlin DSL]
- [ ] Add Kotlin lint check style
